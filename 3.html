  They say, "Oh my god",
  I see the way you shine
  Take your hand, my dear,
  and place them both in mine
  You know you stopped me
  dead when I was passing by
  And now I beg to see you
  dance just one more time
  Ooh, I see you, see you,
  see you every time
  And I, I, I, I like your style
  You, you make me, make me,
  make me wanna cry
  And now I beg to see you
  dance just one more time
  So I say
  Dance for me, dance for me,
  dance for me, oh oh oh
  I've never seen anybody
  do the things you do before
  They say
  Move for me, move for me,
  move for me, ay ay ay
  And when you're done
  I'll make you do it all again
  I said, "Oh my god",
  I see you walking by
  Take my hands, my dear,
  and look me in my eyes
  Just like a monkey,
  I've been dancing my whole life
  And you just beg to see me
  dance just one more time
  Ooh, I see you, see you,
  see you every time
  And I, I, I, I like your style
  You, you make me, make me,
  make me wanna cry
  And now I beg to see
  you dance just one more time
  So I say
  Dance for me, dance for me,
  dance for me, oh oh oh
  I've never seen anybody
  do the things you do before
  They say
